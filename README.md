# Data-Analysis

Analyzing movies dataset from python libraries

* Looking for missing values in the data.
* Adding new columns.Changing datatypes. Sorting the data according to gross revenue. Removing duplicates
* Identifying correlation between budget and gross revenue
* Constructing a regression plot using seaborne library
* Creating a heatmap to depict the percentage of correlation


My findings after analyzing the movies dataset are presented in the jupyter notebook, along with my code.
